= gstopwatch =

Okay, so apparently there are absolutely zero good stopwatches around for X11!
I spent my time searching but couldn't find one simple enough for me. This
stopwatch will start counting, stop counting, and reset, a like the simple
pocket stopwatch I had growing up.

== Usage ==

press space to start timing, space to stop, space again to reset and start
timing again.


== Building ==

You'll need the gtk 2.x libraries and headers installed and ready to go. to
build, simple run make in the gstopwatch folder 

== To Do == 

* Laps
* Hours:Minutes:Seconds display
* Font size
