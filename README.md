gstopwatch 
----------
Okay, so apparently there are absolutely zero good stopwatches around for X11!
I spent my time searching but couldn't find one simple enough for me. This
stopwatch will start counting, stop counting and reset.

Usage 
-----
Press space to start timing, space to stop, space again to reset and start
timing again.


Building
--------
You'll need the gtk 3.x libraries and headers installed and ready to go. To
build, simple run make in the gstopwatch folder 

ToDo 
----
* Laps
* Hours:Minutes:Seconds display
* Font size
